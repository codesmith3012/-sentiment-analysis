Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning
This project is a Sentiment Analysis system that classifies text data (e.g., customer reviews, social media posts) as positive, negative, or neutral. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text and applies machine learning models to determine the sentiment behind the text.

Features
Text Preprocessing: Cleans, tokenizes, and vectorizes the input text for further analysis.
Sentiment Classification: Classifies the sentiment of the text as positive, negative, or neutral.
Multiple ML Models: Implements various models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.
Evaluation Metrics: Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the classifierâ€™s performance.
Optional Web Interface: Users can input text and receive sentiment classification results through a simple interface.
Use Cases
Customer Feedback Analysis: Identify sentiment in customer reviews to better understand customer satisfaction.
Social Media Monitoring: Analyze sentiments in social media posts, tweets, or comments.
Product Review Classification: Automatically classify product reviews as positive, neutral, or negative.
Technologies & Libraries
Python: Core programming language for building the classifier.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning model development and evaluation.
NLTK & SpaCy: For natural language processing tasks like tokenization and stopword removal.
Flask (optional): For creating a user-friendly web interface.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing the sentiment distribution.
